Printing the binary representation of any Number.

void pr_binary(int num){
    for(int i=10;i>=0;i--) cout<<((num>>i)&1);
    cout<<endl;
}
2 ) checking if the ith bit is set or not.

if((num&(1<<i))!=0) cout<<"set"<<endl;
  // check if set or not;
  else cout<<"Not set"<<endl;
3 ) Counting the number of set bits

  int count=0,num=15;
  for (int i=31; i>=0;--i)
  if((num&(1<<i))!=0) count++;
4) How to check if a given number is a power of 2 ?

Properties for numbers which are powers of 2, is that they have one and only 
one bit set in their binary representation. 
If the number is neither zero nor a power of two, it will have 1 in more than 
one place. So if x is a power of 2 then x & (x-1) will be 0.
eg.-> 16-> 10000 and 15 -> 1111 
16&15==0

 bool isPowerOfTwo(int x)
  {
      return (x && !(x & (x - 1)));
  }
5) Dividing or multiplying any number by two

 //Although the arithmetic operations are fast ,but by bits manipulation 
// we can make them  more faster.
  int n=5;
  n=n>>1;
 // divide by two
  n=n<<1;
 // multiply by two
6 ) Some cool operations and playing with Characters

Difference between upper case letter and lower case letter binary is that
 In upper case letter 5th bit!=1;
 In lower case letter 5th bit =1;
 cout<<char('A'|(1<<5))<<endl;     //Convert Char to lower case;
 cout<<char('a'&(~(1<<5)))<<endl;    //Convert Char to upper case;

 Actually char of 1<<5 is _(space);
 Take any upper case letter and its |(or) with space will get the corresponding lower case letter;

 cout<<char('C'|' ')<<endl;   // will make it small c
 
Take any lower case letter and its &(and) with _(underscore) will get the corresponding upper //case letter;`

 cout<<char('c'&'_')<<endl;   // will make it capital C
 
 
Find a letter’s position in alphabet
We can easily find a letter’s position [1-26] in the 
alphabet by taking its bitwise AND with ASCII 31 (00011111 in binary). 
The case of the letter is irrelevant here. 
 
 eg.
 (‘A’ & 31) returns position 1
 (‘c’ & 31) returns position 3
7 ) Swap with XOR.

  int a=4;
  int b=5;
  a=a^b;
  b=b^a;
  a=a^b;
  // cout<<a<<" "<<b;
8 ) For clearing the set bits upto ith bit

 int i=4;
//clearing upto 5 the place;
int a=59;
int b=(a&(~((1<<(i+1))-1)));
//clearing the lsb upto ith bit;


i=3;
int c=(a&((1<<(i+1))-1));
//clearing the msb upto ith bit;
